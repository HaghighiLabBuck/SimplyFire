# Version 0.5.2 (first release of this fork)

-Plot window now keeps the minimum of data in memory, avoiding freezing for large files (>15 min total recording time)
-Undo can be disabled for filtering only, this saves considerable time for large files as well
-Filtering always applied to whole recording regardless of current selection, avoiding irregularity at selection bounds
-Active axis change using keyboard can now be toggled rather than changing by holding down a key
